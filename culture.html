    <h1>Culture</h1>
    <p>
      The culture of Canada embodies the artistic, culinary, literary, humour, musical, political and social elements
      that are representative of Canadians. Throughout Canada's history, its culture has been influenced firstly by its
      indigenous cultures, and later by European culture and traditions, mostly by the British and French. Over time,
      elements of the cultures of Canada's immigrant populations have become incorporated to form a Canadian cultural
      mosaic. Certain segments of Canada's population have, to varying extents, also been influenced by American
      culture due to shared language (in English-speaking Canada), significant media penetration and geographic
      proximity.

    <p>The Portuguese mansions on the Coast, the half-timbered architecture in the Itajaí Valley and in the North of the
      State and the Italian traditions still strong in the West are concrete examples of the cultural diversity of Santa
      Catarina, today enriched with the addition of new accents and customs of those who chose Santa Catarina to live.
      To protect this wealth, Santa Catarina's cultural circuit is made up of dozens of architectural complexes listed
      by the National Historical and Artistic Heritage Institute (Iphan) or by the State and municipalities. In addition
      to the architectural and artistic heritage, there are also collections in museums.

      There are historical groups that represent other European ethnicities that also participated, on a smaller scale,
      in the colonization of the State. The city of Treze Tílias, in the Midwest, was founded by Austrian immigrants
      from the Tyrol region and looks like a typical village straight out of the Alps. Two other ethnic groups with
      architectural contributions that deserve mention are the Poles and the Ukrainians.</p>
