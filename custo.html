    <h1>Cost of living</h1>
    <p>According to Numbeo, the average cost of living in Canada is around 2,200 Canadian dollars per month, excluding
      rent. It is important to note that these values ​​are only averages and may vary depending on location, type of
      housing, energy consumption, food and other factors.</p>
    <p>Canada is not one of the cheapest countries when it comes to cost of living. The prices quoted here are
      estimates, considering that monthly expenses in Canada may vary depending on the city and each person's.</p>
    </p>
      Toronto is the largest city in the country, as well as being an important financial and cultural center. The rent
      for a one-bedroom apartment outside the center is around CAD$2,112, while a three-bedroom apartment can cost
      CAD$3,300. Basic bills such as electricity, water and internet are around CAD$300 in total. Adding food and public
      transport prices, the total monthly expenses for one person in Toronto is approximately CAD$3,575.
    </p>
    <p>Canada has one of the highest minimum wages in the world. This is one of the reasons why their quality of life indexes are so high.

      The minimum wage in Canada is CAD$16.65 per hour. This is the minimum amount required of employers by the Federal Government of Canada. If we consider a workload of 40 hours per week, the Canadian minimum wage per month is CAD$2,648.
      
      However, a student can only work 20 hours a week in the country. In this case, your monthly income would be CAD$1,324. However, it is allowed to work up to 40 hours a week during school holidays, an excellent period to earn extra income!
      
      Another interesting fact is the average salary in the country. In Canada's three main cities - Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal - the average salary is around CAD$26.83 per hour worked.
      
      In Canada, salaries are paid in a different way than what we are used to here in Brazil. There, it is common for employers to pay weekly or biweekly. Therefore, many accounts can also be billed weekly.
