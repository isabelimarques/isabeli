    <h1>Canada</h1>
    <p>Canada is a country that is in North America and is the second largest country in the world in terms of
      territorial extension, behind only Russia. It has rugged terrain and climates that vary from Temperate, further
      south, to Arctic, in the north The Canadian population today is just over 37.7 million inhabitants, who are
      concentrated in the southern portions of the territory.The country has high social and economic indicators,
      currently being one of the largest economies on the planet.</p>

    The discovery of the Canadian territories was made by the navigator John Cabot, from England, in 1497. Their
    colonization began with the French in 1554. Over the years there were many disputes over land between England,
    Canada and the thirteen colonies ( U.S).Due to these disputes, the Quebec Act was issued by the English, which
    allowed the French in Canada. Therefore, to this day we have reflections of disputes in today's society, such as the
    two official languages ​​(English and French) in the regions.
    <p>Canada is as big as it is inhospitable. They have the four seasons well defined. Thus, summer can register 35 ºC,
      while winter can register minus 50 ºC. The temperature fluctuation depends on the region. The climate limits the
      supply of arable land and there is little availability of crops in most of the territory. The territory is bathed
      by numerous rivers and crossed by several mountain ranges. Canada's temperate climate varies depending on the
      relief, precipitation and atmospheric pressure. The most temperate area is found on the coast of British Columbia.
      In this region, the influence of hot and humid air currents that leave the Pacific is intense. Snow is rare in
      this region. The warm, moist air coming off the Pacific Ocean is trapped in the Cordillera area, which forms the
      Coast Range and Rocky Mountains. Unable to advance towards the plains, the humid air crosses the mountains, where
      it cools and falls in the form of rain. Rain, however, is less in the valleys between the mountains and,
      therefore, there are high temperature summers.</p>
